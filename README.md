# MESA
These are codes I have written for MESA (https://github.com/MESAHub) projects on different stellar and planetary evolution problems.

To run pipeline with logs, make sure that your environment variables are properly loaded then run

python3.11 -u runscript_mesa.py >> logs_run.txt &

-u flag will flush out all Python messages without any buffer.
